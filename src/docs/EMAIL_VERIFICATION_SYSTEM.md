## User Flow

### New User Signup
1. User creates account → Verification email sent
2. User sees verification step with instructions
3. User clicks verification link in email
4. User returns to signup and clicks "I've Verified My Email"
5. User proceeds to club setup

### Existing Unverified User
1. User logs in → Verification banner appears
2. User can click "Resend Email" to get new verification link
3. User verifies email → Banner disappears
4. User can now create posts

### Post Creation Protection
1. Unverified user tries to create post
2. Generate button is disabled with "Email Verification Required"
3. Tooltip explains verification requirement
4. User must verify email before proceeding

## API Endpoints Required

### Backend Implementation Needed
1. **POST** `/api/users/register/` - Send verification email on registration
2. **POST** `/api/users/verify-email/` - Verify email with token
3. **POST** `/api/users/resend-verification/` - Resend verification email
4. **GET** `/api/users/me/` - Return user data including `email_verified` field

### User Model Fields
- `email_verified` (boolean) - Whether user has verified their email
- `verification_token` (string) - Token for email verification
- `verification_token_expires` (datetime) - Token expiration

## Email Template

### Template Location
- **File**: `src/templates/EmailVerificationTemplate.html`
- **Purpose**: Reference template for backend email system
- **Features**:
  - Professional MatchGen branding
  - Clear call-to-action button
  - Feature highlights
  - Fallback link for button issues
  - Responsive design

### Template Variables
- `{{verification_link}}` - The verification URL with token
- `{{user_email}}` - User's email address

## Security Considerations

1. **Token Expiration**: Verification tokens should expire (recommended: 24 hours)
2. **Rate Limiting**: Limit resend verification requests
3. **Token Uniqueness**: Each verification token should be unique and single-use
4. **HTTPS**: All verification links must use HTTPS
